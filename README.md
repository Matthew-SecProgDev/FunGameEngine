[![Under Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-under%20development-orange)]()

## Overview

**FunEngine** is a game engine currently being built using the MonoGame framework. It provides some core functionalities needed to develop 2D games, including rendering, input handling, and more. As development continues, additional features will be added to enable the creation of both 2D and 3D games in the future.

## Solution Structure

This solution consists of two projects:

1. **Fun.Engine**: This is the main engine project, as described above. It includes the foundational elements necessary for game development.
2. **Fun.SimpleGame**: It serves as an example of how to use the engine to develop a game, showcasing the features and capabilities of FunEngine. As the engine evolves, more projects and examples will be created to demonstrate its growing capabilities.

This solution is currently in **active development**. New features, improvements, and bug fixes are continuously being added. Stay tuned for updates as the engine continues to evolve.
